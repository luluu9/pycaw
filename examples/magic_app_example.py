"""
Note
----
'import pycaw.magic' must be generally at the topmost.
To be more specific:
It needs to be imported before any other pycaw or comtypes import.


Reserved Atrributes
-------------------
Note that certain methods and attributes are reserved for the magic module.
    Please look into the source code of MagicApp for more information.
But to avoid conflicts now and in the future, i recommend using
a prefix for each of your custom methods and attributes.


Features
--------
Instantiate a new MagicApp with one or more app executables:

magic = MagicApp({"msedge.exe", "another.exe"})

--------

you could also inherit from MagicApp and create customized callbacks:

class MyCustomApp(MagicApp):
    def __init__(self, app_execs):
        super().__init__(app_execs,
                         volume_callback=self.custom_volume_callback,
                         mute_callback=self...,
                         state_callback=self...,
                         session_callback=self...)

    def custom_volume_callback(self, volume):
        print(volume)
        print(self.mute)
        self.mute = True
        print(self.mute)

mega_magic = MyCustomApp({"msedge.exe"})
